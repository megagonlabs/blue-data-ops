"""One renderer, three formats, every command.

"Every command honours every format" is a claim about every command that returns a result,
and the only way to keep it is to have one implementation of it. So a command builds a
:class:`Result` — the columns, the rows, the JSON object, and a sentence or two of prose —
and hands it here. Adding a format is a branch in :func:`render`; adding a command costs
nothing.

The guard that is not optional: **operator output is untrusted**. A record value can be
whatever a language model wrote or whatever came out of a data source, and a CSI escape
sequence in it walks the terminal cursor, which is how a screen comes to show one record
under a footer reporting two. Rich's own ``strip_control_codes`` leaves ESC in place and
``markup=False`` defends only against Rich's own ``[bold]`` syntax, so the strip here is the
one that matters, and it runs on every cell in every format.

In ``json`` the strip runs on string *values*. Keys are left as ``json.dumps`` writes them:
with ``ensure_ascii`` on, every control character in a key is escaped, and a key is a token
a consumer matches on rather than text it prints, so rewriting one would break the match.

There is no ``csv``. A record bundle here is ``list[list[dict]]`` — groups of records — and
CSV has no representation for the group boundary, so flattening one would silently merge
groups into a single table. This CLI offers ``json``, ``table`` and ``nl``.

Stdout carries the result and nothing else. Progress, logs, warnings and errors are the
caller's other stream, so every format is safe to pipe.
